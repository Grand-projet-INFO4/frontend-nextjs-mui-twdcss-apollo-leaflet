# The App router

This `app` directory is where Next.js 13 build up the routing system of the application as well as the components that should render for each route.

## Providers

At the root of this `app` directory lies a component called `Providers.tsx`. This component is responsible for mounting all the providers that should sit at the level of the application's component tree of all routes.
